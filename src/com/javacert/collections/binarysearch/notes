Set will work, but does not return seats in order.
Set is a unordered collection and doesn't allow duplicates
List is a ordered collection and does allow duplicates
HashSet will return a unordered collection
LinkedHashSet will return ordered collection
Binary Search uses comparable to make searching more efficient
Binary Search is a searching algorithm used in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.
The idea of binary search is to use the information that the array is sorted and reduce the time complexity to O(Log n)
