When overriding the equals() method in the HeavenlyBody class, we were careful to make sure that it would not return
true if a HeavenlyBody was compared to a subclass of itself

We did that to demonstrate that method, but it was actually unnecessary in the HeavenlyBody class.
The mini challenge is just a question: why was it unnecessary?

Answer:

The HeavenlyBody class is declared final, so it cannot be subclassed. The Java String class is also final, which is why
it can safely use the instanceOf method without having to worry about comparisons with a subclass
